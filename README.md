# markov
Underlying source code used for my [interactive Markov Chain text generator](https://etpc.dev/proj/markov).
The algorithm uses [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to predict text output based on a user's input.
*Made without 3rd party libraries. (Only Python stdlib)*
